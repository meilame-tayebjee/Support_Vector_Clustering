# Support Vector Clustering

This project has been realised for the Advanced Machine Learning course of the MEng @ ENSAE (Paris, France) by Prof. Austin Stromme.

It is based on the paper _Support Vector Clustering_ by Asa Ben-Hur, David Horn, Hava T. Siegelmann and Vladimir Vapnik in 2001 (article available in the repo: Paper.pdf).

We reimplement the SVC algorithm in _SVC.py_.

_Tests.ipynb_ contains tests on synthetic data, with careful parameter tuning for SVC and comparison with classic algorithms, namely: K-Means, Agglomerative Clustering and DBSCAN.

In _Report.pdf_, we remind key highlights of each algorithm with a special focus on SVC, and we detail and comment our results.
